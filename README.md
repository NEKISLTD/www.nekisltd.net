 NEKISLTD 2020  &lt;/h3> &lt;p>Operating system The first decision you need to make when choosing a desktop is which operating system to choose and at present you have two main choices an Apple device running the Macintosh operating system or a&lt;/p> &lt;p>device that runs Microsoft Windows. Which you choose really depends on your own personal preferences, if youâ€™re used to Apple devices or Windows devices then you will need to go through a learning curve to switch, however&lt;/p> &lt;p>the time taken to get up and running in either is negligible. Most desktops on the market run the Windows operating system and give you access to millions of applications written for the platform. There are fewer&lt;/p> &lt;p>applications written for Apple devices, however that doesnâ€™t mean you canâ€™t run your favourite Windows software&lt;/p> &lt;p> www.nekisltd.net
